# DSM driver for realtek RTL8152/RTL8153/RTL8156 based USB Ethernet adapters

This is an RTL8152/RTL8153/RTL8156(2.5Gbps or 1.0Gbps) driver package for Synology NASes.

* [UASP(USB Attached SCSI Protocol for external storage devices) driver package for Synology NASes](https://github.com/bb-qq/uas)

## Supported NAS platform

* DSM 7.x and 6.2
* Almost all models released after 2017
  * Older models also work, but you may not have enough performance.
  * [Compatibility reports](https://github.com/bb-qq/r8152/wiki/Compatibility) by the community will help you.

You can download drivers from the [release page](https://github.com/bb-qq/r8152/releases) and determine a proper driver for your model from [knowledge base of Synology](https://www.synology.com/en-global/knowledgebase/DSM/tutorial/Compatibility_Peripherals/What_kind_of_CPU_does_my_NAS_have), 

I would appreciate it if you could report whether it works. If you have any problems, the [Troubleshooting](https://github.com/bb-qq/r8152/wiki/Troubleshooting) page may help.

***NOTE***: I recommend using front ports to connect devices because some users reported stability issues when they use rear ports.

### Author's environment

The author uses the following environments daily and it has confirmed that these devices work stably.

* NAS
  * DS918+ (apollolake) with 16GB RAM
  * DSM 7.2-64570 Update 3
  * Ethernet dongle
    * USB-LAN2500R2 (RTL8156BG, only in Japan.)
* PC
  * Ethernet card
    * [AQN-107](https://amzn.to/3RNLg7u) (discontinued, but almost equivalent to [ASUS XG-C100C](https://amzn.to/3fPJUX3))
  * Windows10 SMB3
* Network switches
  * main: [QNAP QSW-2104-2T](https://amzn.to/3Sam3W0) (Broadcom `BCM53161`: x3 2.5Gbe / x2 10Gbe)
  * sub: [keepLINK 5 Port 2.5G Switch](https://amzn.to/41PHpv6) (Realtek `RTL8372`: x5 2.5Gbe / x1 10G SFP+)
    * If you are looking for an affordable 2.5Gbe switch, I recommend products using the RTL837x family, which is a newer generation of chips and consumes less power. Many other products are available from many vendors.

## Supported RTL8156(2.5Gbps) based devices

**INFO**: Products using RTL8156**BG** have dramatically lower power consumption(up to 64% decrease) and heat generation than those using RTL8156.

* [ASUSTOR AS-U2.5G](https://amzn.to/2ZRx1pi) (RTL8156/Type-C to A)
  * NOTE: The included Type A-C conversion adapter is directional. There is a mark on one side of the USB-C connector that must be on the same side as the USB logo on the adapter.
* [ASUSTOR AS-U2.5G2](https://amzn.to/3u5wUH4) (RTL8156B/Type-C to A)
  * NOTE: Same above.
* [CLUB 3D CAC-1420](https://amzn.to/2ZPmzKD) (RTL8156/Type-A)
* [TRENDnet TUC-ET2G](https://amzn.to/2PLmR5v) (RTL8156(V1.0)/RTL8156BG(V2.0)/Type-C)
  * NOTE: Customer support states that RTL8156BG was adopted in V2.0. However, there is no way to distinguish V1.0 from V2.0. Can we expect the new ones to be v2.0?

See the [Compatibility page](https://github.com/bb-qq/r8152/wiki/Compatibility) for the latest information.
* If you have other products not listed and it does not work, please create an issue with the output of lsusb.
* If you are using a product with a Type-C connector, you will need a connector or cable to convert it to Type-A.
  * For stable device operation, I recommend using a USB 3.2gen2 10Gbps compatible cable.
  * A 5Gbps cable is sufficient for this driver to work, but a 10Gbps capable cable can be expected to have higher transmission quality.

## Supported RTL8157(5Gbps) based devices
* [WisdPi USB 3.2 5Gbps Ethernet Adapter WP-UT5](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DF2TTT9H) (RTL8157/Type-C&A TO C)
  
## How to install

### Preparation

[Enable SSH](https://www.synology.com/en-us/knowledgebase/DSM/tutorial/General_Setup/How_to_login_to_DSM_with_root_permission_via_SSH_Telnet) and login to your NAS.

### Installation

1. Go to "Package Center"
2. Press "Manual Install"
3. Choose a driver package downloaded from the [release page](https://github.com/bb-qq/r8152/releases).
4. [DSM7] The installation will fail the first time. After that, run the following command from the SSH terminal:
   * `sudo install -m 4755 -o root -D /var/packages/r8152/target/r8152/spk_su /opt/sbin/spk_su`
5. [DSM7] Retry installation. 
   * You don't need the above DSM7-specific steps at the next time.
6. Reboot your NAS.
   * This procedure is not usually necessary, but many have reported that a reboot was necessary, so please reboot just in case.
7. Open the driver package from the Package Center and start the driver manually.

*Warning*: Do not use Safari for this operation.

## How to configure

You can configure the IP addresses and MTU of the added NICs from the DSM UI in the same way as the built-in NICs.

Option: I recommend setting MTU to 9000 and SMB protocol version to v3 for better performance.

## Performance test

### Environment
* DS918+ (USB-LAN2500R)
* DSM 6.2
* direct connection with PC (AQN-107: discontinued, but almost equivalent to [ASUS XG-C100C](https://amzn.to/3fPJUX3))
* [native iperf3](http://www.jadahl.com/iperf-arp-scan/DSM_6.2/)
    * using docker causes high CPU load
